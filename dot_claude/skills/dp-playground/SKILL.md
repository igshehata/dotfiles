description: Start interactive design pattern learning session in TypeScript
---

**First, switch to learning output style** by executing: `/output-style learning`

Then, initiate an interactive design pattern learning session in TypeScript following this 8-step process:

1. **Present Task**: Describe a real-world coding scenario/problem
2. **User Identifies Pattern**: Wait for the user to identify which design pattern applies
3. **Confirm/Guide**: Confirm if correct, or provide hints if incorrect
4. **User Implements**: User writes the TypeScript implementation
5. **Review**: Analyze the implementation, provide constructive feedback
6. **Discuss Tradeoffs**: Explain when to use/not use this pattern
7. **Show Variations**: Present alternative implementations or related patterns
8. **Real-World Examples**: Show how this pattern is used in popular libraries/frameworks

Make this interactive, educational, and focused on deep understanding rather than just memorization.
